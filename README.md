# Saddle

A demo for the [Pony](http://github.com/mat007/pony) project.

## Prerequisites

The following components are required for building the project:

1. [Go](http://golang.org)
2. [MinGW](http://mingw.org)

## Building

1. Open a MinGW terminal
3. Run `build.bat`

The resulting output is a `bin` folder with a `saddle.exe` application along with all its dependencies.

The build procedure has been intentionaly kept simplistic to be easily merged into any project, team or company usual build infrastructure.
